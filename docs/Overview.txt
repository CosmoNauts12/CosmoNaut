Unified API Engineering Platform

Overview
The Unified API Engineering Platform is designed to provide developers with a structured, visual, and observable environment for designing, executing, and debugging API interactions. The platform supports both individual API testing and complex multi-step execution scenarios that reflect real-world application behavior.

The system is organized into multiple Epics, each addressing a specific layer of functionality. These epics are designed to build incrementally, starting from secure user authentication and workspace isolation, and progressing toward advanced visual workflow design and execution support.

The platform enables developers to:
- Securely authenticate and maintain isolated workspaces
- Create, configure, and execute API requests
- Observe execution results, latency, and failures
- Route API calls through a managed backend execution engine
- Design and execute multi-step API workflows using a visual interface
- Receive contextual guidance and error explanations during scenario building

By combining request execution, centralized observability, and visual workflow modeling, the platform aims to reduce debugging complexity and improve developer productivity. The overall architecture ensures scalability, clarity, and extensibility while maintaining a developer-friendly experience.
