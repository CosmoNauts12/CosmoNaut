Unified API Engineering Platform
Full System Overview

The Unified API Engineering Platform is a full-stack, structured, and visually driven API debugging and workflow orchestration system designed to simplify how developers build, test, observe, and troubleshoot API interactions.

Modern distributed systems rarely rely on a single API call. Instead, real-world applications execute multiple dependent API requests that form complex execution flows. Traditional tools primarily focus on isolated API testing and offer limited visibility into execution paths, replay capabilities, or controlled failure simulation.

This platform addresses those limitations by combining secure authentication, centralized execution, visual workflow modeling, replay capabilities, and workspace-based persistence into a single unified environment.

Core Vision

The platform provides developers with:

A secure and isolated workspace

A unified API execution interface

A managed backend execution engine

A visual multi-step workflow builder

A replay and failure simulation engine

Persistent storage of requests, scenarios, and history

The goal is to reduce debugging complexity, increase observability, and enable structured API engineering within a scalable architecture.
