# Next.js + Bun Application

This is a **Next.js** application bootstrapped using
[`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app)
and configured to use **Bun** as the runtime and package manager.

The project is optimized for fast installs, quick development startup, and
modern full-stack development with the Next.js App Router.
