# 🚀 CosmoNaut Odyssey: The Scrollytelling Experience

Welcome to the **Odyssey**. I've created a completely new, innovative folder `odyssey/` that houses an interactive scrollytelling journey for CosmoNaut.

## ✨ Key Innovations:

1.  **The Pinned Voyager:** Our Astronaut logo is "pinned" to the center of the screen. As you scroll, it doesn't move, but the universe around it does! It changes states—glowing brighter during "Ignition" and scaling up during "Hyper-speed."
2.  **Custom Interaction Engine:**
    *   **Dynamic Custom Cursor:** A sleek, dual-layered cursor that reacts when you hover over links.
    *   **Space-Parallax:** The stars move slightly based on your mouse position, creating a feeling of 3D depth.
    *   **Reactive Backgrounds:** When you reach the "Breaking Atmosphere" scene, the stars literally speed up to simulate light-speed travel.
3.  **Modern Glassmorphism:** The final scene uses a heavily blurred "Mission Success" terminal, creating a premium enterprise feel.
4.  **Glitch Effects:** The opening scene uses subtle CSS glitches to represent the "fragmented" legacy workspace.

## 🛠️ How to View:

1.  **Start a local server:**
    ```bash
    cd odyssey
    python -m http.server 8001
    ```
2.  **Open in Browser:**
    Go to [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)
3.  **The Experience:**
    Simply start scrolling down. Watch the "Status" labels in the top-left of each box change as the Astronaut reacts to the story.

This innovative experience turns a simple software pitch into a **Hero's Journey**. Enjoy the flight! 🌌✨
