EPIC 2: Managed Back-end Proxy and Execution Engine

Objective
Introduce a backend proxy layer that executes all API requests in a controlled, observable, and traceable manner.

Why this Epic Exists
Browser-only execution is limited by CORS and lacks observability. A backend execution engine enables tracing, replay, and timeout enforcement.

User Story 2.1: Centralized Execution via Proxy
BE: Design execution endpoint.
BE: Translate request configurations into real HTTP calls.
BE: Capture full HTTP responses.

User Story 2.2: Uniform Error Handling
Normalize HTTP and network errors.
Return structured error responses.
Log failures for tracing.

User Story 2.3: Timeout Enforcement
Configure timeout limits.
Abort long-running requests.
Return timeout-specific errors.
